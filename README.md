# Test-Repo
A demonstration of Lambda's new PR system

Alright, so let's explain how it should go.

For now, I am not going to style this whole rigmarole, but I will in the future xD.

First off, we need to break down the flow of git. 

When we first learn Git, we follow this simple chain of command:

[Original Repo] --FORK-TO-OUR-REPOSITORIES--> [Fork of 'Original Repo'] --GIT-CLONE-TO-LOCAL--> [Local Copy of Fork]

Then we do our changes to our local copy and then push it to the master of our fork, and that's that.
